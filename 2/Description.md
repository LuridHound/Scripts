2nd script
Sometimes people want to know how many lines of code of each programming language they have in their project.
Run this script in the folder, and choose files to ignore.
After going for a cup of tea, you will see a statistics for the directory and all it's subdirectories.
This statistics shows you (how great you are) number of files in the projects, ignored files and unknown files.
Then you will see which programming laguages you use in your project(this is determined by their extension),
(C and C++ programmers can become confused , becase ".h" belongs to C)
percent of lines of code according to the other files, and number of lines of code itself.
