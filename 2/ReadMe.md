## Motivation
Run this script in the folder and choose files to ignore.
You will see a statistics for the directory and all it's subdirectories.
This statistics shows number of files in the project, ignored files and unknown files.
Then you will see which programming languages you use in your project(this is determined by their extension),
percent of lines of code according to the other files, and number of lines of code itself.

### Example
``` cpp
=======================================
