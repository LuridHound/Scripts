1st script
https://www.spriters-resource.com/
This site provides a huge ammount of textures for different old games. But when I download any .png file, each file 
contains the name of the game in the filename of this file. That's why I wrote script to erase after downloading all images,
that you need for the development.



2nd script
Sometimes people want to know how many lines of code of each programming language they have in their project.
Run this script in the folder, and choose files to ignore.
After going for a cup of tea, you will see a statistics for the directory and all it's subdirectories.
This statistics shows you (how great you are) number of files in the projects, ignored files and unknown files.
Then you will see which programming laguages you use in your project(this is determined by their extension),
(C and C++ programmers can become confused , becase ".h" belongs to C)
percent of lines of code according to the other files, and number of lines of code itself.
