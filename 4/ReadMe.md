## Motivation

You may need have in a text file all the filenames from the current directory,
that correspond to the some extensions.

Run it from the directory, where all this files are located
(with extensions of the files, that you would like to see)
 and get their names in upper-case format with the serial numbers.
 
### Example
``` cpp
./gamfn .txt .cbp
```
The possible output.

"result.txt"
``` cpp
	.cbp
GAMFN = 0,


	.txt
CMAKECACHE = 0,
RESULT = 1,


```
